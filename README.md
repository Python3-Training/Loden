# Loden
Evolving to support a huge farm of display devices, the goal is to manage a "sea of green" visualization for colorized grids.

Core abstractions support grids as well as command-line processing. Target platforms are decidedly GUI, as well as TUI.

Grids support in-cell text, cell-based metrics, command line events, as well as a scripting-worthy CLI.

The CLI is in [GridCommander.py](https://github.com/Python3-Training/Loden/blob/main/Loden1/GridCommander.py).

Feel free to also open + run [GridTK.py in Loden1](https://github.com/Python3-Training/Loden/blob/main/Loden1/GridTK.py) to see how to make some faces, just 'in time' ...
